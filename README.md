# Vanilla-SPA

**Vanilla-SPA** is a personal project aimed at delving deep into the world of pure and unadulterated JavaScript. The purpose of this endeavor is to gain a profound understanding of the language without the distractions of modern JavaScript frameworks. By embarking on this journey, we aspire to build a solid foundation that will enable us to critically evaluate when and why to use frameworks in future projects, and even whether they are necessary at all for certain tasks.

## Introduction

In today's fast-paced world of web development, it's common to find ourselves inundated with JavaScript frameworks and libraries. Many educational resources and courses often rush through the basics of JavaScript, pushing developers to embrace these frameworks prematurely. While frameworks are undoubtedly powerful tools, they can inadvertently hinder our understanding of JavaScript itself.

**Vanilla-SPA** seeks to address this issue by going back to the roots of JavaScript. We believe that a deep understanding of the core language is essential for becoming a proficient developer. This project is not just about building a single-page application (SPA) with vanilla JavaScript; it's about honing our skills, sharpening our problem-solving abilities, and appreciating the beauty of the language in its purest form.

## Project Goals

1. **In-Depth JavaScript Understanding**: We aim to explore JavaScript thoroughly, understanding its nuances, quirks, and hidden gems. This will provide us with a robust foundation for solving complex problems and debugging effectively.

2. **Framework Evaluation**: Through this project, we will develop the expertise needed to critically evaluate the use of JavaScript frameworks. We will assess whether a framework is the right choice for a particular project or if we can achieve our goals efficiently with pure JavaScript.

3. **Professional Development**: By immersing ourselves in the world of vanilla JavaScript, we aspire to develop a keen developer's eye. We want to be able to discern when to embrace modern tools and when to rely on our JavaScript skills to create elegant and efficient solutions.
